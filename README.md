# Deep Learning Basics

### DELAY ###
I want to provide you with polished notebooks, and I need more time to refine them. The first ones are available now, but the rest will take a few months (around June 2025). Unfortunately, writing about deep learning basics takes time and can't be my primary focus right now.

But I know you'll succeed without me, won't you? üòâ Stay strong and keep pushing forward! I'll do my best to offer you notebooks of the highest quality I'm capable of.

In these notebooks, I update the older parts of "This project updates older parts of "Machine Learning with PyTorch and Scikit-Learn" (Jan 2022) by S. Raschka, and I improve explanations where needed.

In order to update the content and improve the explanations I used various sources online, plus "PyTorch ultimate" (Apr 2024) by B. Gollnick and "A deep understanding of deep learning" (Feb 2025) by M. Cohen.

I have a PhD in math, and I used my abilities to provide correct proofs where S. Raschka failed, which is, unfortunately, almost everywhere he speaks about mathematics üòâ.

At last, the code was difficult for me, and I questioned ChatGPT extensively to get concise and clear line by line explanations.

The original book itself is very well-structured, and S. Raschka guides us through the intricacies of ML and DL masterfully. However, these fields evolve rapidly, making updates necessary.

In the meantime, I hope they enhance your understanding, and that you enjoy reading them!

You can view all the notebooks and associated files directly on my GitHub repository: https://github.com/AlanTuring2000/ML-basics

You may have a better reading experience with nbViewer. You can run the notebooks with Sagemaker Studio Lab. Google Colab is not recommended, because it sometimes render Latex math formulae nonsensically.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Running Locally  
To run these notebooks on your computer, install Jupyter Notebook (or JupyterLab) and dependencies:

  pip install torch scikit-learn jupyter numpy pandas matplotlib colorama

Other small dependencies are handled inside the notebooks.
Some libraries are not handled automatically because it wasn't possible. I explain how to install them directly within the notebooks.
